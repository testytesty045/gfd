# Performance Optimizations for DG Future Tech Website

This document summarizes the JavaScript optimizations made to improve Lighthouse performance scores.

## JavaScript Optimizations

### 1. Initial Issues:
- ReferenceError in framer-motion due to require() in ES module
- Large bundle size (~235 KiB after gzip)
- Unused JavaScript
- Duplicate modules

### 2. Optimizations Implemented:

#### Fixed framer-motion ESM compatibility
- Added @emotion/is-prop-valid dependency
- Replaced require() with dynamic import for ESM environments
- Modified filter-props.mjs to work properly in both development and production environments

#### Added JavaScript Minification
- Implemented TerserPlugin with advanced configuration
- Enabled unused code removal with dead_code and unused options
- Configured console log removal in production builds

#### Implemented Bundle Analysis
- Added webpack-bundle-analyzer for visualizing bundle composition
- Created script to analyze bundles and identify optimization targets

#### Added Module Duplication Prevention
- Added DuplicatePackageCheckerPlugin to identify duplicate packages
- Created custom duplicate package checker script
- Added npm dedupe script for removing duplicates

#### Added Code Splitting
- Implemented utilities for lazy loading components and routes
- Created LazyWrapper component with error boundary
- Added utilities for route prefetching and preloading

#### Custom Webpack Optimizations
- Added ModuleScopeOptimizer for enhanced tree-shaking
- Configured proper chunk splitting and caching
- Improved module concatenation for smaller bundle size

### 3. Results and Next Steps

#### Results:
- Resolved ReferenceError from framer-motion
- Optimized JavaScript bundle size
- Enabled tree-shaking for better dead code elimination
- Implemented code splitting for route components

#### Next Steps:
- Replace heavy libraries with lighter alternatives where possible
- Split large components into code-split chunks
- Implement CSS minification to save another ~129 KiB
- Optimize images for 5,000+ KiB in savings
- Add proper width/height attributes to images

## Usage Guide

### How to use code splitting:

```jsx
// Import utilities
import { lazyRoute, prefetchRoute } from '../utils/route-splitting';

// Create lazy-loaded component
const LazyHome = lazyRoute(() => import('../pages/Home'));

// In your router
<Route path="/" element={<LazyHome />} />

// Prefetch on hover for better UX
<Link 
  to="/about" 
  onMouseEnter={() => prefetchRoute(() => import('../pages/About'))}
>
  About
</Link>
```

### Check for duplicate packages:
```bash
npm run check-duplicates
```

### Run bundle analyzer:
```bash
npm run analyze
```

### Build with all optimizations:
```bash
npm run build
```
