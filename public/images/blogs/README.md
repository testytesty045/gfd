# Blog Images

This directory contains images used in blog posts.

## Image Path Conventions

All blog images should be placed in this directory (/public/images/blogs/).

When referencing images in blog HTML content, use the path format:

```html
<img src="/images/blogs/image-name.jpg" alt="Image description" />
```

The image paths in the JSON blog content have been updated to point to this directory.

## Missing Images

Please ensure all blog images are copied to this directory from their original locations.
